CarePulse  enables patients to easily manage their healthcare journey. With a user-friendly interface, patients can sign up, fill out a detailed form with their personal data, family history, current medication, and more. They can then select their preferred physician, choose a date and time, and receive confirmation of their reserved appointment.
On the administrative side, authorized personnel can access a secure dashboard to manage appointments, schedule, or cancel them as needed. The platform also provides valuable insights with statistics on pending, canceled, and scheduled appointments.
